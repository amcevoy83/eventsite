	<h3 class="reviewtitle">Bruce Springsteen @ Kilkenny Castle</h3>
	<h4>13 May 2013</h4>
		<p>Highlights for Boss connoisseurs included request sign renditions of ‘Wild Billy’s Circus Story’, which someone with far more spare time than me reckons he last played four years ago in Madison Square Garden; ‘Man At The Top’, which hadn’t got a run out since 1985 in Washington DC and an especially fab cover of The Searchers’ ‘When You Walk In The Room’, which was a Bruce staple in the ‘70s but, again, hadn’t been played live by the E Street Band since 2009.</p>
<br><br>
<p>‘Dancing In The Dark’ was notable for Springsteen not only having his traditional boogie with an attractive young lady, but also his plucking out of the crowd of a young lad holding a “Can I play guitar with you?” sign.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Following the throwing of some seriously impressive shapes, Bruce presented the twanging tween with one of his acoustics, albeit minus a beloved a capo that he removed first.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Born To Run got played again in its entirety; The Boss’ keening at the end of ‘The River’ sent shivers up many a Nowlan Park spine and a charged ‘American Skin (41 Shots)’ spoke not just for Amadou Diallo and Trayvon Martin, but all the people who’ve been ill-served by the US justice system.</p>
