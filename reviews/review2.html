	<h4>23 September 2015</h4>
		<p>“It would have been ironic if he’d played at The Joy,” says one wag in the lobby, referring to the theatre across the street. Instead, Morrissey is at The Saenger, – a Baroque, star-ceilinged auditorium with a history that locals love to reminisce about in romantic tones, and which stands proud and defiant despite intermittent batterings. The choice seems appropriate, even if they’re confiscating the gladioli in the lobby.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Morrissey is kicking off this leg of his tour in the least American city in the US. Not that he’s averse to the continent - his cultural touchstones are awash with Americana and his LA love affair is well documented. As with his beloved England, though, it seems to be a case of “Love this country, hate this nation”.</p>
<br><br>
<p>As Louisianans like to say, “This is LA, not L.A.” The upshot: we’re not in Hollywood any more, Toto, and after the introductory adrenaline shot of Suedehead, there’s nothing showbusiness-like about the overtly political salvos of Ganglord.</p>

		<p> Eighteen months ago, Bridges was washing dishes in a Texas restaurant; three months ago, 40 record labels had shown interest in him. He went for Columbia (“for the vibes”), and chose Communion to promote his UK show (presumably for the success of the label – co-founded by Mumford & Sons’ Ben Lovett – with Ben Howard and Michael Kiwanuka). His falling into the vintage soul soup was a roundabout thing. Until only a few years ago, Bridges’ interests were dancing and 90s R&B artists like Ginuwine and Usher; he went on to study the former at community college, and still dances now. “I never thought about making music, though.” Surely you were aware that you could sing? “I was aware that I could sing, but I wasn’t all that confident. That was for other people.”</p>
