	<h4>23 September 2015</h4>
		<p>Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you’d like to. Unless you’re Leon Bridges. “On stage, people probably don’t notice,” says the 27-year-old, his words softening into a sweet, southern drawl. In all areas of his life – on stage, on record, and on the highly stylised black-and-white photos on his Instagram account – he wears the style of more than a half of a century ago. His music is restrained, tasteful soul from the misty age just before the Beatles, its collars just-so, a resuscitation of Sam Cooke for the 2015 vintage crew.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p> Eighteen months ago, Bridges was washing dishes in a Texas restaurant; three months ago, 40 record labels had shown interest in him. He went for Columbia (“for the vibes”), and chose Communion to promote his UK show (presumably for the success of the label – co-founded by Mumford & Sons’ Ben Lovett – with Ben Howard and Michael Kiwanuka). His falling into the vintage soul soup was a roundabout thing. Until only a few years ago, Bridges’ interests were dancing and 90s R&B artists like Ginuwine and Usher; he went on to study the former at community college, and still dances now. “I never thought about making music, though.” Surely you were aware that you could sing? “I was aware that I could sing, but I wasn’t all that confident. That was for other people.”</p>
